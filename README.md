# Online Bookstore SQL Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **SQL-based database design** for an online bookstore.  
It includes **database creation, table structures, relationships, sample data insertion, and example queries** for analysis.

## ðŸ—‚ Database Structure
The database contains the following tables:
- **Authors** â€“ Stores author details.
- **Books** â€“ Stores book details, linked to authors.
- **Customers** â€“ Stores customer information.
- **Orders** â€“ Stores order records for customers.
- **OrderDetails** â€“ Stores books purchased in each order.

## âš™ Features
- Create and manage a relational database for a bookstore.
- Insert sample data for testing.
- Run queries to retrieve useful insights such as:
  - Books with their authors
  - Total sales per book
  - Orders with customer details

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- MySQL (compatible with MariaDB or other SQL-based systems)
- ANSI SQL for queries

## ðŸ“‹ Example Queries
```sql
-- List all books with their authors
SELECT b.Title, a.Name AS Author, b.Price
FROM Books b
JOIN Authors a ON b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID;

-- Find total sales per book
SELECT b.Title, SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Books b ON od.BookID = b.BookID
GROUP BY b.Title;
